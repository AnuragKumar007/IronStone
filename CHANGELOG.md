# IronStone — Development Log

> Daily progress tracker. Updated at the end of each working session.

---

## Day 1 — 2026-04-10

### What was done
- Created separate Firebase project (`ironstone-91903`) — independent from ProgressTracker
- Configured `.env.local` with Firebase client SDK keys, Admin SDK service account key, and Razorpay/Resend placeholders
- Enabled Firebase Auth (Email/Password + Google OAuth) and Firestore (test mode, asia-south1)
- Fixed auth flow — login and signup now properly redirect to `/home`
- Added client-side route protection:
  - `(protected)` layout redirects unauthenticated users to `/login`
  - `(auth)` layout redirects authenticated users to `/home`
- Fixed COOP header in `next.config.ts` for Google popup auth
- Fixed Navbar — auth-aware links (Home only shows when logged in), logout button, removed dead `/house` route
- Deleted duplicate `house` page
- Wrapped `setSessionCookie` in try-catch so login doesn't break if admin SDK is unavailable
- Added debug logging to AuthContext (can be removed later)

### Status
- **Phase 1 (Foundation & Auth):** Complete
- **Phase 2 (Design System & Components):** Not started
- **Phase 3 (Content Pages):** Not started
